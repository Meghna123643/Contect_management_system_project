# Contect_management_system_project
This is a simple Contact Management System built using Python. It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete contact information. The project uses file handling to store contact data persistently in a text file and organizes the logic using functions for better modularity and readability.

🔧 Features:
Add new contact (Name, Phone, Email, etc.)

Display all saved contacts

Search for a contact by name or phone number

Update existing contact details

Delete a contact

Data stored using text file handling (no external database)

🛠 Technologies Used:
Python (Core Concepts)

File Handling (open(), read(), write(), etc.)

Functions for modular design

📁 How It Works:
All contact details are stored in a .txt file.

Each operation (add, update, delete, etc.) interacts with this file.

Data persists between runs of the program.

🔄 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas):
Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt

Use a database like SQLite for better data management

Add validation and duplicate checking
